This repository contains replication code and other materials for "Poor Neighborhoods, Bad Schools? A High-dimensional Model of Place-based Disparities in Academic Achievement."

Some of the data on which this analysis is based are restricted-access or proprietary and can only be obtained under contractual arrangements that preclude their dissemination by the authors.

Researchers interested in obtaining these data may follow the procedures outlined at:

https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/licenses.asp for the ECLS-K; and

https://geolytics.com/neighborhood-change-database-2010 for the NCDB

The specific files/extracts used from these sources are documented within the replication code.

Once these data files have been obtained, the user will need to:

1. install the required Stata and R packages documented within the replication code
2. appropriately update the directory paths in all Stata do files and R scripts
3. run _master_do_file.do
